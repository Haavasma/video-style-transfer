\subsection{Results with Wasserstein metric and temporal constraint}
\label{sec:Results with wasserstein metric}
Our custom implementation of neural style transfer with temporal constraint and Wasserstein metric to define style loss made the computation a bit slower than with only the temporal constraint, but the stylized video turns out more convincing. \newline
Resolution used: 1024x576
The weights for the loss function we used for these videos were 4 for style, 1000 for content, 100 000 000 for temporal

As we can see here, the Wasserstein method provides very nice artistic quality. The combination of this together with the temporal constraint creates a high quality video with little noise.
