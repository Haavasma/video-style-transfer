For all the following implementations we have used Python 3 as our primary programming language. We used TensorFlow as our machine-learning framework, and we used OpenCV for doing operations on images, videos, and for calculating optical flow. We also chose Adam as our optimizer because it is fast and it performs favorably compared to other stochastic optimization methods. In addition to that, we have incorporated the total variation loss to get rid of high frequency artifacts as discussed in Section \ref{sec:loss functions}.
