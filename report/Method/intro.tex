For all the following implementations we have used Python 3 as our primary programming language. We did our machine learning work in TensorFlow and we used OpenCV2 for handling of images and videos. We also chose Adam Optimizer as our choice of optimizer because it is fast and it performs favorably compared to other stochastic optimization methods.
