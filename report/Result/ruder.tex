\subsection{Results with implemented temporal constraint}
\label{seq:ruder_result}
In Section \ref{sec:Ruder style transfer} we described the main purpose of our implementation if Ruder, which is to reduce the noise and flickering found in our standard video style transfer. To do this we implemented a temporal constraint as well as Deepflow. The results can be seen in the videos below.\newline
Resolution used for the results is 1024x576.\newline
The weights used for these results were 0.02 for style, 10.000 for content and 100.000.000 for temporal loss.

\end{itemize}
As we can see, the amount of background noise and flickering in the video has been reduced compared to standard style transfer. The background of the images stays mostly still and does not have the same randomness in details as the previous version. Otherwise the quality of the styling is retained, as it uses the same styling algorithm as standard style transfer.
