\subsection{Results with standard style transfer}
Here are links to two videoes rendered with our implementation of the original style transfer with gram matrices, first studied by Gatys et al. \cite{Gatys:1}.\newline
Resolution used for the results is 1024x576. The weights used for these results were 0.02 for style and 10.000 for content.

As we can see, without temporal loss even adjacent frames can be quite different, resulting in significant flickering. This does create a cool effect of its own though, as if each frame was made as a separate artwork, and not meant to be a smooth, digital, animation.
