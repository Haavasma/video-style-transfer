This report is the final delivery for our video style-transfer project for TDAT3025. Image style-transfer is trying to recreate an image as if it was made in the style of another reference image. Video style-transfer is image style-transfer taken a step further. Styling an entire video with a single style image is not just the process of image style transfer repeated for each frame. Issues ranging from stability of output images to runtime occur and need to be addressed. The purpose of this report is to compare existing ways of implementing video style transfer and to implement our own versions based on these. In this report we start off by shedding light on multiple papers written in this field so far. We have implemented several of these papers, and combined some as our own exploration in this field. Our implementations are discussed under "Methods", and thereafter we go through our results and discuss them.
